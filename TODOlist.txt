Aleksander (the non shady one):
  Cyclic order counter logic, fix state machine.

Aleksander (the shady one):
  Do networking logic with order states and continous brodcasting, pass information from other elevators to calculate local order states.
  Function to return all active elevators, and to get list of orderstates for specific ordertype for all elevators.
  Networking appears to not work.
 
 Elias (the one and only):
  Cost function for assigning orders using information about local elevator state and states of other elevators. 
  Kun hall orders blir bestemt behandlet, mens cab orders m√• ta del i beregningen.
  
Someone (pls just anybody):
Bugs
